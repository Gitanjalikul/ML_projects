# ML_projects

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I've worked on. Each project folder contains the source code, datasets (or links to datasets), and a README file specific to the project that explains the goals, methods, and results.

## Project List

1. Sales Prediction
Objective: Predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on age and estimated salary.
Algorithms Used:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Key Metrics:
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve and AUC Score for Logistic Regression
K-Value Graph for KNN

Files:
data/DigitalAd_dataset.csv - The dataset used for the project.
src/sale_prediction.py - The Python script for training and evaluating the models.
roc_curve.png - The ROC curve generated for logistic regression.
k_value_graph.png - The K-value error graph for KNN.

More details can be found in the Sales Prediction project folder.
